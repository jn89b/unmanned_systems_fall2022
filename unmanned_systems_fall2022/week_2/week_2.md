# Week 2 - Unmanned Systems Lab 

## Resources to watch:
If you would like to prepare yourself for the lab and or want some additional resources attached are some good videos to watch. You don't need to watch them but shoud be helpful for you. 

- Djikstras: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazC3A4OQTE&t=2s

- Big O Notation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__vX2sjlpXU

- Priority queue: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-in-python/

- Working with classes and why: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM

- Lists, Tuples, Sets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8KRzm-HUcc

# Objectives
Today's objectives will be the following go over:
- Djikstras
- Big O Notation
- Priority Queue 

- Data Structures:
    - List
    - Tuple
    - Dictionaries 
    - Sets 

- Classes: 
    - Why do we use them

- Unit testing:
    - Manual 
    - Automated 

- How to build an algorithm, brick by brick

## Why Unit Testing?
- We do this to verify and validate that our functions will work, typically we'll write a function and then verify if it works by printing. But in real life we will write tests for functions or classes and verify that these will return the results we expect.

- In Python we will use a module called unittest to do this. 


### Common assertions used from unittest
```python 
.assertEqual(a, b)	a == b
.assertTrue(x)	bool(x) is True
.assertFalse(x)	bool(x) is False
.assertIs(a, b)	a is b
.assertIsNone(x)	x is None
.assertIn(a, b)	a in b
.assertIsInstance(a, b)	isinstance(a, b)
.assertLessEqual(first, second, message)
.assertLess(first, second, message)
.assertGreater(first, second, message)
.assertGreaterEqual(first, second, message)
```
