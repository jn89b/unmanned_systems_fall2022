# Unmanned Systems LAB 1
- Today in Lab we will do the following:
  - Set up your Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  - Set up your github and demonstrate 
  - Introduction to Python 
    - For loops 
      - Four different ways
        - In range
        - duck typing
        - zip 
        - list comprehension
    - What is numpy?
    - Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
      - Classes 
        - Attributes - what does it have?
        - Methods - what can it do?
        - Quick demonstration 
    - Matplotlib:
      - Plotting toolkit
      - Examples
  - Programming tips:
    - Think transfer function: input -> output
      - What inputs do we want to give to the method/function? 
      - What outputs do we want to get out?
      - Don't make a function or method do "too" much
      - Will Smith: Brick by brick 
  - Tieing it in with homework:
    - Nodes
    - Build the 2d->index equation 
    - Can we make it better?


## For loop exercise
- Using a for loop create a multiplication table for 12, from values of 0 to 12

## OOP Exercise
- Create a class Robot:
  - It should have the following attributes
    - Min and max speed 
    - Min and max turn
    - Initial position [x,y]
    - Name
  - Have a method called turn on:
    - It should print the name and notify that its turning on
  - Have a method called turn off 
    - It should print the name and notify that its turning off

## Plotting exercise
